# PreyPredator
Animal-World game simulation. WPF C# using .NET framework. Contains Interfaces, Polymorfie, Abstact classes, IList items and etc.

In this simulation, there are many lice and ladybugs (lice being the favorite food of ladybugs). The simulation starts with a specific number of ladybugs and lice. With each click of the button, one round passes. During each round, the animals move around randomly and attempt to reproduce. Predators (ladybugs) also try to hunt their prey (lice).

This game needs to be expandable that's why Interfaces and Abstract classes are used
